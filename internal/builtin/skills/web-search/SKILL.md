# Web Search Skill

Search the web for live, verifiable information using SearXNG—a privacy-respecting metasearch engine. This skill uses `curl` to query SearXNG's JSON API.

## Required Configuration

**The `SEARXNG_ENDPOINT` environment variable MUST be set to use this skill.**

Before performing any search, check that it's configured:

```bash
echo "${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT:-NOT_SET}"
```

- **If output is `NOT_SET`**: Stop and inform the user they need to set `SEARXNG_ENDPOINT`
- **If output is a hostname**: Proceed with the search using that endpoint

Example user configuration:
```bash
export SEARXNG_ENDPOINT=search.example.com
```

## When to Use

SearXNG is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine that aggregates results from multiple sources. Results may be delayed by several days compared to direct Google searches.

Activate this skill when:
- User needs to verify facts, claims, or research topics
- User asks about events or news older than a few days
- User wants to find documentation, articles, or references
- User asks "find information about..." or "search for..."
- User needs multiple perspectives on a topic
- Information needs to be cited with sources
- User asks about something that may have changed since your training

**Less suitable for:**
- Breaking news from the last 24-48 hours (results may be delayed)
- Real-time information (stock prices, live scores, etc.)
- Rapidly developing situations in progress

## Performing Searches

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Verify endpoint is configured**:
   ```bash
   echo "${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT:-NOT_SET}"
   ```
   If `NOT_SET`, tell the user to configure `SEARXNG_ENDPOINT` and stop.

2. **Execute the search**:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT}/search?q=YOUR+QUERY&format=json" | head -c 50000
   ```

### Search Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `q` | Search query (required) | `q=golang+error+handling` |
| `format` | `json` (required for API) | `format=json` |
| `categories` | `general`, `news`, `images`, `videos`, `science`, `it`, `files`, `social media`, `music`, `map` | `categories=news` |
| `time_range` | `day`, `week`, `month`, `year` | `time_range=week` |
| `language` | Language code | `language=en` |
| `engines` | Specific engines | `engines=google,duckduckgo` |
| `pageno` | Page number | `pageno=2` |

### Example Searches

**General search:**
```bash
curl -s "https://${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT}/search?q=kubernetes+pod+networking&format=json" | head -c 50000
```

**News from the past week:**
```bash
curl -s "https://${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT}/search?q=AI+regulation&format=json&categories=news&time_range=week" | head -c 50000
```

**Technical search with specific engines:**
```bash
curl -s "https://${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT}/search?q=react+hooks+performance&format=json&categories=it&engines=stackoverflow,github" | head -c 50000
```

## Response Format

The JSON response contains:

```json
{
  "query": "your search query",
  "number_of_results": 12345,
  "results": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/page",
      "title": "Page Title",
      "content": "Snippet or description text",
      "engine": "google",
      "publishedDate": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "answers": ["Direct answers if available"],
  "suggestions": ["related", "search", "queries"],
  "infoboxes": [
    {
      "infobox": "Topic Name",
      "content": "Summary information"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `results` | Array of search results with url, title, content, engine |
| `answers` | Direct answers (e.g., calculations, simple facts) |
| `suggestions` | Related search queries to explore |
| `infoboxes` | Knowledge panel-style summaries (Wikipedia, etc.) |

## Search Strategies

### For Current Events/News

```bash
curl -s "https://${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT}/search?q=TOPIC&format=json&categories=news&time_range=day" | head -c 50000
```

### For Technical Topics

```bash
curl -s "https://${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT}/search?q=TOPIC&format=json&categories=it&engines=stackoverflow,github,google" | head -c 50000
```

### For Fact Verification

Run multiple searches with different phrasings:
1. Search the exact claim
2. Search for counterarguments
3. Search for primary sources

## Parsing Results with jq

For more precise extraction:

```bash
# Extract just titles and URLs
curl -s "https://${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT}/search?q=QUERY&format=json" | jq -r '.results[:10] | .[] | "\(.title)\n  \(.url)\n"'

# Get suggestions
curl -s "https://${SEARXNG_ENDPOINT}/search?q=QUERY&format=json" | jq -r '.suggestions[]'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `NOT_SET` from endpoint check | `SEARXNG_ENDPOINT` not configured | User must set the environment variable |
| HTML response | JSON API disabled on instance | User must enable JSON API on their SearXNG instance |
| Empty results | Query too specific | Broaden search terms |
| Connection refused | Instance offline or misconfigured | User must check their SearXNG instance |

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify endpoint first** - Check `SEARXNG_ENDPOINT` before any search
2. **Be specific in queries** - Include relevant context and keywords
3. **Use appropriate categories** - `news` for current events, `it` for technical topics
4. **Check multiple sources** - Don't rely on a single result
5. **Note publication dates** - Prioritize recent sources for time-sensitive topics
6. **Cite your sources** - Include URLs when presenting information
7. **Limit output** - Always pipe through `head -c 50000`

## Output Format

When presenting search results to users:

```markdown
Based on my web search:

**Summary**: [Your synthesis of the findings]

**Key Sources**:
- [Title](URL) - [Brief note on relevance]
- [Title](URL) - [Brief note on relevance]

**Note**: [Any caveats about the information]
```

When endpoint is not configured:

```markdown
Web search is not available. Please set the `SEARXNG_ENDPOINT` environment variable to your SearXNG instance:

export SEARXNG_ENDPOINT=search.example.com
```
